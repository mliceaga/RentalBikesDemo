The design is simple, there is an strategy pattern for implementing different rates, a context class (RentalCalculator), an Interface
named IPromotion that is implemented in FamilyRental.cs.

I applied some architectural patterns, best practices, error handling, basic logging and some TDD through the usage of unit tests.

To run the app just open in VS2017+ and execute all the tests from the project "UnitTests".
